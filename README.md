# OLED Eye Animation using Arduino / ESP32

This project demonstrates **animated eyes on an SSD1306 OLED display** using Arduino or ESP32.  
The eyes can blink, sleep, wake up, move in different directions, and show emotions like happy, sad, angry, cute, and suspicious.

The project is inspired by **EMO-style robotic facial expressions** and can be extended for robots, AI assistants, or interactive IoT systems.
